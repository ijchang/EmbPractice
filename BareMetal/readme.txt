1. Use "arm-none-eabi-objdump.exe -d xxx.o" to display the disassembly code of the object file. This is better for watching than looking at xxx.s file which is generated by "arm-none-eabi-gcc -S xxx.c -o xxx.s"

2. Use "arm-none-eabit-objdump.exe -h xxx.o" to display the summary of each section like .txt, .data, .bss, etc. You can use it to check the size of each section

3. If you use -D to dump disassembly code, it shows all sections include .data, .bss sections. But with -d, it only shows executable section, that is .txt

4. If you want to display both source code and disassembly code, you must first generate xxx.o with -g option in arm-none-eabi-gcc cmd. By doing so, the DWARF debugging information will be built into binary code. Then you use -S option in arm-none-eabi-objdump cmd to display both source code and disassembly code mixed together.

5. If you want to view all the symbols of the application, you can use "arm-none-eabi-nm.exe final.elf" to show the symbols
